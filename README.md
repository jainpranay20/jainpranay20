# 👋 Hi, I'm Pranay Jain

I am a passionate Full-Stack Software Developer with 2 years of experience, currently working at IBM ISL. I have a results-driven mindset and hands-on experience in developing and optimizing enterprise dashboards and device management platforms. Proven expertise in building responsive and intuitive UI components using React and Carbon Design System, coupled with solid backend development using Java, Spring, and RESTful APIs.

Strong understanding of microservices architecture, DevOps practices, and cloud-native deployments using Docker, OpenShift, and Jenkins. Passionate about crafting clean, scalable solutions that improve usability and operational efficiency.

I pursued my M. Tech from IIIT Bangalore, and during my time there, I worked on various projects related to DevOps, Docker, Ansible, and web applications. Additionally, I explored Spring Boot, React, and Java, gaining a solid understanding of shell scripting and Linux system calls.

As a software professional, I am always eager to take on new challenges and strive to stay updated with the latest industry trends. I enjoy collaborating with others and constantly seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills.
